# Heart Disease Prediction 💓

Explore the fascinating world of predicting heart disease using the [Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) dataset. This project aims to unveil the secrets hidden in personal key indicators to create a powerful heart disease prediction model.

## Workflow 🚀

### Data Collection:

- The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).
- Dive into the dataset to understand the various indicators and their potential impact on heart health.

### Pre-Processing & Analysis:

- Conduct data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into the relationships between different indicators and heart disease.

### Modelling:

- Utilize powerful machine learning models like ExtraTreesClassifier to predict the likelihood of heart disease.


### Evaluation:

- Assess the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
- Interpret the results to understand how well the model generalizes to new data.

## Model Evaluation 📊

- Train the model using ExtraTreesClassifier.
- Evaluate the model on the test set and analyze the confusion matrix and accuracy.
- Achieved accuracy: 97.16%.
- Precision, recall, and f1-score are also provided for a comprehensive understanding.
